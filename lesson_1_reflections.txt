How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It helped me so much !
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Different versions allows me to collect and analize changes in every iteration.
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: meaningful iterations. Cons: meaningless iterations.
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Files might be highly interconnected.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
I can see the history using diff log cmd and dig into changes using git diff cmd.
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I always can rollback to previous versions.
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
For version controlling !
